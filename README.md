# grid-sheet-project
it is a program that basically works on a grid numbered horizontally and vertically from 0 to l (l is the lenght of the side of big square) and make some modification.
to this program some people are added with their coordinates, then it takes series of orders like adding more people,removing some people,moving one from one place to another,and finally printing the grid.
here is an example of test cases:
init 2 5 \\initializing: 2:number of people, 5:l
a 3 2
b 4 1 \\adding people with their coordinates
add c 1 1 \\ adding c to (1,1)
rm b \\ remove b
mov a 1 2 1 4 \\ move a 2 to the right and 4 up
vis \\ print the grid
